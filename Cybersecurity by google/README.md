# CYBERSECURITY BY GOOGLE

In January 2024, I embarked on a journey to deepen my understanding of cybersecurity through Coursera's Google Cybersecurity Certificate program. After months of dedicated learning, I'm thrilled to have completed the course, earning six certificates along the way.

This experience has been transformative, equipping me with the foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary to navigate the complex world of cybersecurity. I've uploaded my certificates here as a testament to my progress and commitment to this field.

But this is just the beginning. I'm eager to continue exploring the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, honing my skills, and staying at the forefront of emerging threats and technologies.

Check out my certificates and feel free to connect with me to discuss all things cyber!
