#  Network Security Threats

## 1. Malware
Malware, short for "malicious software," is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. The term malware encompasses various types of harmful software, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and other malicious programs.

- **How it works**: Malware is often introduced through phishing emails, malicious downloads, or compromised websites. Once inside the system, it can steal data, encrypt files for ransom, or disrupt operations.
- **Examples**: WannaCry ransomware, which affected numerous organizations worldwide, encrypting data and demanding ransom.
- **Impact**: Malware can cause significant financial loss, data breaches, and operational downtime.
- **Real-world incident**: In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware attack affected over 200,000 computers across 150 countries, causing widespread disruption in healthcare, finance, and other sectors ([CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-threats-advisories), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)).

## 2. Phishing
Phishing is a type of cyberattack where attackers pretend as a trustworthy entity to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. It is a form of social engineering that exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities or loopholes.

- **How it works**: Attackers send emails or messages that appear to be from reputable sources, prompting recipients to click on malicious links or attachments.
- **Examples**: Spear-phishing attacks targeting specific individuals within an organization.
- **Impact**: Phishing can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and unauthorized access to systems.
- **Real-world incident**: In 2013, a phishing attack on Target Corporation resulted in the theft of 40 million credit and debit card records, costing the company millions in damages and remediation ([CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-threats-advisories), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)).

## 3. Ransomware
Ransomware is a  malicious software designed to block access to a computer system or data until a ransom is paid. It is a common and significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape due to its potential to cause extensive damage to individuals, businesses, and organizations.

- **How it works**: Ransomware spreads through malicious email attachments, software vulnerabilities, or compromised websites. Once it encrypts the files, it demands payment for the decryption key.
- **Examples**: CryptoLocker, Petya, and Ryuk.
- **Impact**: Ransomware can halt business operations, lead to data loss, and incur substantial financial costs for decryption and recovery.
- **Real-world incident**: The Colonial Pipeline attack in 2021 led to significant fuel supply disruptions across the U.S. East Coast, with the company paying a $4.4 million ransom to restore operations ([CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-threats-advisories), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)).

## 4. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. DDoS attacks are effective because they leverage multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices.
- **How it works**: Attackers use multiple systems to generate massive amounts of traffic, exhausting the target's resources and preventing legitimate users from accessing services.
- **Examples**: SYN flood, ping of death, and botnet-based attacks.
- **Impact**: DoS attacks can lead to significant downtime, loss of revenue, and damage to a company's reputation.
- **Real-world incident**: In 2016, the Mirai botnet launched a massive DDoS attack on Dyn, a DNS provider, disrupting services for major websites like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit ([CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-threats-advisories), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)).

## 5. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is a cyberattack where the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. This type of attack can be used to steal sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal data.

- **How it works**: Attackers position themselves between the victim and the intended recipient, capturing and possibly altering the transmitted data.
- **Examples**: Eavesdropping on Wi-Fi networks, HTTPS spoofing.
- **Impact**: MitM attacks can lead to the theft of sensitive information, financial loss, and unauthorized access to systems.
- **Real-world incident**: In 2015, the Superfish adware installed on Lenovo laptops was found to be performing HTTPS MitM attacks, compromising users' secure web traffic ([CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-threats-advisories), [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)).
